# Hidden Files

Files and folders can be hidden by putting a period in front of the file/folder name (e. g. `.hiddenFile`). Hidden files/folders are usually meant to be used by applications or operating systems to hide configuration files etc.

Apart from that, the following files and folders are hidden:

- Desktop.ini
- Thumbs.db
